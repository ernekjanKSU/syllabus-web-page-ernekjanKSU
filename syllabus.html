<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p>This course explores the standards, technologies, 
and strategies used in modern web application development.  
The ultimate goal is to develop the foundational 
theoretical and practical knowledge that will allow you to work 
with an endless variety of we stacks and frameworks, rather than 
focusing on a single technology or approach.</p>

<p>We have a lot of ground to cover, so we will be moving very quickly through the material.  
It is vital that you both keep up, and ask questions when you don't understand.  
Make good use of office hours.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You should have completed CIS 501 with a C or better, and have 
the equivalent experience of CMST 135 with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
If you do not, I strongly recommend you take a (free) crash 
course on HTML & CSS through <a href="https://codecademy.com">https://codecademy.com</a>
or wait until you have taken CMST 135 before joining this course.</p>

<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>At the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create three-tier web applications</li>
	<li>Be experienced with Agile development</li>
	<li>Understand and articulate the user interface issues, data structures, 
	algorithms, an design patterns common to web development</li>
	<li>Consider the memory and computational implications of software designs</li>
	<li>Develop an understanding of how techniques used in web programing 
	can be beneficially incorporated within general development efforts</li>
	<li>Be able to quickly learn web frameworks implemented in different languages</li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Outline</h3>
<p>The following is a general layout, and is subject to change:</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML5, CSS3, and user agents</li>
<li>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol</li>
<li>ECMA Script 2015 (ES6)</li>

<li>Reactive Web Apps</li>
<li>WebSockets</li>
<li>Embedded HTML Templates</li>
<li>Full-Text Search</li>
<li>Tagging Systems</li>
<li>User-Centered Design</li>

</ol>

<h3>Course Structure</h3>
<p>In recognition of the importance of hands-on learning, this course utilizes a blended lecture/lab 
format, where theoretical understanding is immediately put to use programming software drawing upon 
that theoretical understanding.  Effective learning following this strategy _depends_ upon active 
participation; accordingly it is necessary to both attend class and participate in in-class activities 
to succeed.</p>

<p>Further, we will be embracing problem-based cooperative learning approaches at the 
midpoint of the semester where we will shift to small group work, developing an original 
and useful web application drawing upon the knowledge you have gained throughout the semester.  
To help promote accountability, peer reviews from this phase will account for the equivalent 
of a letter grade.</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>While there is not an assigned textbook for this course, 
there are a number of extremely helpful resources you will want to use.</p>

<h3>Github Classroom</h3>
<p>We will be using the Github Classroom to for obtaining starter code and submitting assignments.  
The classroom can be reached here: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/25181973-k-state-spring-17-cis-526-class">https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/25181973-k-state-spring-17-cis-526-class</a>.
</p>

<p>If you have not yet, I strongly encourage you to sign up with Github as a student: <a href="https://education.github.com/">https://education.github.com/</a>.</p>

<h3>Safari Online</h3>
<p>K-State libraries has obtained a Safari Books Online library containing over 6k current titles.  
You can access this collection using your eid and password here: 
<a href="http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.er.lib.k-state.edu">
http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.er.lib.k-state.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>Websites and Wikis</h3>
<p>The following are some helpful websites for web development</p>
<ul>
<li>W3C Standards <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page">https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page</a>(<a href="https://www.w3.org/standards">https://www.w3.org/standards</a>)</li>

<li>W3C Web Education Community Group Wiki <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page">https://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/Main_Page</a></li>

<li>Mozilla Developer Guide <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Course Software</h3>

<ul>
<li>Node.js (for webserver development) <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">https://nodejs.org/en</a> Node is a fast 
server-side JavaScript engine based on Google's V8 JavaScript interpreter.  
We will be writing our webserver using Node.</li>

<li>Atom (Integraged Development Environment) <a href="https://atom.io">https://atom.io</a> 
Atom is an IDE that uses HTML5 and JavaScript as its underlying technologies, 
which akes it a natrual fit for web development.  
You will also want the atom-html-preview package <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview">https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview</a>. </li>

<li>Google Chrome (Web Browser) <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">Google chrome</a> is a fast, 
cross-platform web browser with a robust set of developer tools.  
See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">https://developer.chrome.com/devtools</a> for details.  
While you will always want to verify your web app using all browsers, we will be grading your work 
based on its performance in Chrome.</li>

<h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
<p>Each unexcused absence will reduce the student's class participation grade by 10%.</p>

<h3>Late Work</h3>
<p>Late work (with the exception of emergencies) will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Subject to Change</h3>
<p>The details in this document are not set in stone - there may need to be changes made during 
the semester.  If this occurs, the changes will be posted to K-State Online, my personal website, 
and emailed to all students.</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>Kansas State University has an Honor & Integrity System based on personal integrity which is presumed to be 
sufficient assurance in academic matters one's work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. 
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor & Integrity System. 
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate 
and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning.</p>

<p>A component vital to the Honor & Integrity System is the inclusion of the <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/honorsystem/pledge.html">Honor Pledge</a>
 which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, _whether or not_ it is stated: __"On my honor, as a student, 
 I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."__</p>

<p>The default in this class is that ALL work will be accomplished individually, UNLESS my permission is given in advance of an assignment/quiz/exam/take-home exam/final. If you are in doubt, please ask</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/honor/faculty/xfagree.html">grade of XF</a> can result from a breach of 
academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an 
Honor Pledge violation.</p>

<p>For more information, visit the Honor & Integrity System home web page at: 
[http://www.k-state.edu/honor/](https://www.k-state.edu/honor/)</p>

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact 
the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.  Services are available to students with 
a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, 
learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. 
If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, 
contact the Student Access Center at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu), 
785-532-6441.</p>

<h3>Classroom Conduct</h3>
<p>All student activities in the University, including this course, 
are governed by the (Student Judicial Conduct Code)[http://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/] 
as outlined in the Student Governing Association (By Laws)[http://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf], Article V, Section 3, number 2.
